Interval Extension (區間延展)
============================

A pattern theory for attributing attendance records.

INTRODUCTION
============

Each attendance interval could set extend times in front and behind, so the extend times could be configurable below:

1. Normal Clock In extented time
2. Normal Clock Out extented time
3. Overtime Clock In extented time
4. Overtime Clock Out extented time

For example, `Normal Clock In extented time` means that if the time is set as `3H` and the Normal Clock In time is `9:00`, then you can only Check In availably after `6:00`.
